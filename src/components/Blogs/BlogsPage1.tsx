              Civil Rights for Gig Workers: Understanding Protection in the Modern Economy
              </h1>
              <p className="text-justify line-clamp-3">
              One might say gig-working is a one-night- stand of jobs. No commitments, no “see you in the morning,” no criticism for wearing sweatpants, and no toxic relationships. Even the word “gig” itself is something of a joke. It’s only three letters and it’s half of the word “giggle.” How much of a responsibility could half of the word giggle be?

              Back when America was a sparkle in the eyes of a bunch of guys in bloomers and ridiculous hairdos, a disagreement arose. See, these guys had just come from England, and the English king (who also wore girlish pants and ridiculous hairdos) was mean to them. The king made them pay excessively high taxes on trivial items, like tea and stamps, and said derogatory things about their mamas (Only kidding on that last part, but the king was kind of a bully).

              A few decades ago, a worldwide conversation about bullying began. Finally, all the kids with low self-esteem and feelings of inferiority, and those who generally wore clothing their parents picked out for them, could come to gather, identify the elephant in the room, and take a stand. Bullying was no longer a coming-of-age right, it was a travesty and needed to be stopped.

              Let’s get one thing straight. No one wants to be a complainer. People don’t like complainers; they’re always pointing out what’s bad about something and ruining it for everyone else. Just think about people who complain about food in a restaurant. The waiter doesn’t like them because he thinks the complaint will negatively effect his tip, the cook doesn’t like them because they suggest that his cooking is under par, and his fellow diners don’t like him because he is embarrassing them and killing the vibe.

              If you think Judge Judy is the “judge supreme,” you must not leave your house very often. Sure, when you’re on your couch, Judge Judy can seem pretty powerful, and she does know her way around cat-fights, keyed cars, slumlords, and aggressive dogs, but she doesn’t quite have the authority of the Supreme Court.
