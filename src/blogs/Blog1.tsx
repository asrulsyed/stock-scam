        Understanding Product Liability
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Product liability refers to a manufacturer or seller being held liable
        for placing a defective product into the hands of a consumer.
        Responsibility for a product defect that causes injury lies with all
        sellers of the product who are in the distribution chain. The main
        categories of product liability include:
      </p>
      <ul className="ml-10 list-outside list-disc">
        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">Manufacturing Defects: </span>
          &nbsp;When an error in manufacturing occurs, making a product
          dangerous.
        </li>
        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">Design Defects: </span>
          &nbsp;When the product design is inherently dangerous or
          useless(regardless of impeccable manufacturing).
        </li>
        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">Marketing Defects: </span>
          &nbsp;When the marketing misleads consumers about the proper use or
          the risks of the product.

      </ul>

        Are manufactureres commonly held liable when their negligence causes
        users of their products to be injured?
      </h3>

      <p className="text-justify">
        Manufacturers bear significant responsibility for injuries and damages
        caused by their products, underpinned by the legal doctrine of product
        liability. This doctrine holds manufacturers, distributors, and
        retailers accountable for releasing products that they should reasonably
        have known were defective or potentially hazardous.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        When any of these defects cause harm, the manufacturer can be required
        to compensate for medical costs, lost wages, pain and suffering, and
        other damages. The key to their liability is proving that the defect
        existed and that it directly caused the injury. This responsibility is a
        fundamental aspect of consumer rights protection, ensuring that the
        product hitting the market are safe for use.

              <span className="font-bold">Design Defects: </span>
              &nbsp;These are inherent flaws in the product's design that pose a risk
              to consumers, potentially causing injury even if the product is
              made perfectly according to the design specifications.

              <span className="font-bold">Marketing Defects: </span>
              &nbsp;Often referred to as "failure to warn," these defects arise when a
              product lacks necessary instructions or warnings that could
              prevent the consumer from an unforeseen danger during normal or
              foreseeable use.

          caused harm.
